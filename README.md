# Machine-Back-Translation-NMT

Extended the implemented the paper ["Investigating Backtranslation in Neural Machine Translation" ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06189) for Indian languages that is Hindi-Gujarati language pair.

Motivation: A high-quality NMT system can be trained by back-translating monolingual data to produce synthetic parallel corpora, which can then be combined with real parallel data. This technique has recently been demonstrated by researchers. When developing cutting-edge NMT systems, backtranslation has become standard practise, especially in settings where resources are scarce. This is because massive amounts of fresh parallel text become accessible only very occasionally.
